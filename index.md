This lesson introduces environmental sustainability principles in the context of 
high performance computing (HPC) systems. Understanding the scale of emissions from 
different sources is critical to being able to make changes to work in a more environmentally
sustainable way. This lesson will give you the ability to understand emissions arising from
use of HPC systems and how to quantify them. We will use practical examples and real data from
an existing HPC facility to illustrate the concepts.

We use the [UK National Supercomputing Service, ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk) as an 
example throughout this lesson but the principles and learning should be applicable to 
any HPC system.

After completing this lesson you should:

- Be able to understand the concept of carbon efficiency and how it relates to energy efficiency -
  including cases where energy efficiency can be at odds with carbon efficiency
- Know about how HPC systems potentially reduce emissions
- Understand carbon intensity of electricity generation and the implications for carbon aware use
  of HPC
- Appreciate the embodied emissions associated with HPC hardware and how they impact carbon aware
  use of HPC
- Be aware of the frameworks used to measure and report on carbon emissions and how the terms used
  in these frameworks map onto HPC
- Gain practical advice on how you can measure and improve the carbon efficiency of your use of
  HPC

## Target audience

Anyone involved in using or delivering HPC resources - a user, a developer of software for use on HPC, an HPC service operator, or those involved in procuring HPC systems. By attending this course, you will be able to better understand the effect of HPC systems on carbon emissions, where it fits with emissions from other activities, and what concrete actions can be taken to reduce emissions and the size of the impact from these reductions. No knowledge of environmental sustainability principles is assumed.
